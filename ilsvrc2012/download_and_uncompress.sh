# TWO Script Arguments
#  1. SYNSETS_PATH: A .txt file with the unique synset labels.
#  2. SAVE_DIR  (optional): Where to create the 'ilscvrc2012/' output.
#
# ONE Script Output
#  1. 'ilscvrc2012/' is saved to SAVE_DIR/ or current working directory.
#
# Script Usage
#  $ cd [path to this script]
#  $ ./download_and_uncompress.sh [unique synsets txt file] [directory]
#
# Example of Script Usage
#  $ cd get_imagenet/ilsvrc2012/  # README.md is here.
#  $ ./download_and_uncompress.sh unique_synsets.txt ./
#
# Notes on Usage
#  1. Obtain a username and access_key, by registering at image-net.org.
#  2. If URLs break, be sure to update the four corresponding variables:
#      (1) BASE_URL,
#      (2) TRAIN_BBOX_URL,
#      (3) TRAIN_IMGS_URL, and
#      (4) VALIDATION_IMGS_URL.
#
# Notes on Dataset
#  1. This only downloads images used for the ILSVRC2012 competition.
#  2. However, images used for the object localization challenges 
#      have remain unchanged since 2012 (as of 2018).
#  3. 1,283,166 images in the training set.
#  4. 50,000 images in the validation set.

set -e  # Exit script if any of the following commands fail.

# Set IMAGENET_ACCESS_KEY and IMAGENET_USERNAME.
if [ "x$IMAGENET_ACCESS_KEY" == x -o "x$IMAGENET_USERNAME" == x ]; then
  cat <<END
In order to download the imagenet data, you have to create an account with
image-net.org. This will get you a username and an access key. You can set the
IMAGENET_USERNAME and IMAGENET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables, or you can
enter the credentials here.
